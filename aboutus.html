      <h2>About Us</h2>

      <p>
        Protherm was established in 1993 By Tim Kilvington. Following a gradual
        expansion over 27 years the company invested £1,000,000 in 2016 on the
        purchase of new premises and state of the art duct forming machinery.
        This has allowed the company to significantly increase its capacity in
        the manufacture of ductwork in both square and spiral ductwork.<br /><br />
        Protherm is now the largest ductwork manufacturer in the north of
        England and the only company able to manufacture both rectangular and
        circular ductwork. With a very experienced management team we are able
        to carry out projects in excess of £800,000. Our philosophy is to offer
        a comprehensive service from quotation through to contract
        completion.<br /><br />
        Our CAD team are experienced in working with all AutoCAD disciplines and
        have been carrying out 3D modelling for more than 20 years. We are able
        to work with BIM models and Revit. Drawings are produced using Autodesk
        MEP and cad-duct which are intern downloaded through our CNC machines
        and fabricated by skilled operators within our 12,000 square foot
        workshop. The workshop has been carefully designed and fitted out with
        the very latest ductwork machinery to maximise our production
        capabilities.<br /><br />
        With our multi-tiered management approach, we are able to deal with
        potential problems at an early stage. Our site supervisors regularly
        visit site co-ordinating and liaising with our clients. This is then
        backed up by contracts managers and technical support. We have a
        reputation for offering a high-quality service at competitive prices.<br /><br />
        We regularly Liaise with our clients from tender stage offering
        solutions and innovations that our vast experience has gathered. Value
        engineering can help secure the work for our clients as we work together
        as a team.<br /><br />
        We are the first company our clients come to when our competitors fail
        to deliver.
